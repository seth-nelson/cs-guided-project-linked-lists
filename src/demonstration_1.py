"""
Given only a reference to a specific node in a linked list, delete that node from a singly-linked list.

Example:

The code below should first construct a linked list (x -> y -> z) and then delete `y` from the linked list by calling the function `delete_node`. It is your job to write the `delete_node` function.

```python
class LinkedListNode():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None

x = LinkedListNode('X')
y = LinkedListNode('Y')
z = LinkedListNode('Z')

x.next = y
y.next = z

delete_node(y)
```

*Note: We can do this in O(1) time and space! But be aware that our solution will have some side effects...*

class LinkedListNode():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None

def delete_node(delete_this_node):
    next_node = delete_this_node.next
    # copy all of the next node into the current node we are "deleting"
    # start with the value
    if next_node is not None:
        delete_this_node.value = next_node.value
        # skip over the next_node in our linked list
        delete_this_node.next = next_node.next
    else:
        print('Sorry, the last node cannot be deleted using this technique.')

x = LinkedListNode('X')
y = LinkedListNode('Y')
z = LinkedListNode('Z')

x.next = y
y.next = z

delete_node(y)
